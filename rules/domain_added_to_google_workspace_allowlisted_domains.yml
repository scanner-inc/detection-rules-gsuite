name: Domain added to Google Workspace allowlisted domains
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a domain is added to Google Workspace's allowlisted domains.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Google Workspace logs to identify when a domain is added to the allowlisted domains. An attacker may add a trusted domain to lower security controls for data exfiltration or collection.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Contact the user or service account owner to verify if this action is legitimate.
  2. If legitimate, consider adding the user to a suppression list.
  3. If not, use the user investigation dashboard to check if the user has taken other actions.
  4. If the triage results suggest malicious intent, initiate your company's incident response process and investigation.
