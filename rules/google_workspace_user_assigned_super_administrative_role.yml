name: Google Workspace user assigned super administrative role
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user is added to the Super administrator role on Google Workspace.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace logs for `ASSIGN_ROLE` events indicating the Super administrator role.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify with the Google admin if the user should legitimately be given the super admin role.
  2. If the user was not legitimately added, investigate activity from the IP address that made the role addition.
  3. Review activity around the Google Workspace admin who made the change and the newly added super admin.
