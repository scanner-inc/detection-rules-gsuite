name: Google Workspace administrator has disabled 2-step verification for organizational
  unit
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a Google Workspace administrator disables 2-step verification (2SV) for an organizational unit.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace logs for instances of administrators disabling 2SV. An attacker with initial access may disable 2SV to weaken security controls.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Check for other signals and logs related to the impacted user, looking for deviations in the following properties:
      - Application
      - Device
      - Geolocation
      - IP address
  2. Reach out to the user to confirm if they recognize the activity.
  3. If the activity is not legitimate, block the user from signing in and initiate your Incident Response process.
