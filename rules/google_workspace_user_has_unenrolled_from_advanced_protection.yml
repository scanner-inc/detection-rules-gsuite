description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a Google Workspace user unenrolls from Advanced Protection.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace logs for user unenrollment from Advanced Protection, which may indicate a security compromise.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Check for other signals and logs generated by the impacted user, looking for deviations in:
      - Application
      - Device
      - Geolocation
      - IP address
  2. Confirm with the user if they recognize the activity.
  3. If the activity is unauthorized, block the user's sign-in and initiate Incident Response.
