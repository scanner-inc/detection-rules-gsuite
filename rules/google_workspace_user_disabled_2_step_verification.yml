name: Google Workspace user disabled 2-step verification
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a Google Workspace user disables 2-step verification (2SV).

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace logs for instances of users disabling 2SV, as this may indicate a compromised account.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Review other signals and logs linked to the affected user, looking for deviations in:
      - Application
      - Device
      - Geolocation
      - IP address
  2. Contact the user to confirm if they recognize the activity.
  3. If the activity is unauthorized, block the user from signing in and initiate the Incident Response process.
