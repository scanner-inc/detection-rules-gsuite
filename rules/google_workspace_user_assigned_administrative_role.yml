name: Google Workspace user assigned administrative role
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user is added to an administrator role on Google Workspace.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace logs to detect role assignment events where the role has the suffix "_ADMIN_ROLE."

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify with the Google admin if the user should legitimately be given the admin role.
  2. If the user was not legitimately added, investigate activity from the IP address that made the role addition.
  3. Review activity around the Google Workspace admin who made the change and the newly added admin.
