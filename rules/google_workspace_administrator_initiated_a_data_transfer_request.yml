name: Google Workspace administrator initiated a data transfer request
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a Google Workspace administrator initiates a data transfer request.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace logs to identify when an administrator requests to transfer ownership of a user's data to another user within the same organization. This request typically occurs when a user has left the organization, but it could also be misused by an attacker to exfiltrate data to a compromised account.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Assess whether there is a legitimate reason for the data transfer request.
  2. If the request lacks a legitimate reason, investigate the activity of the Google Workspace administrator and the IP address that initiated the request.
