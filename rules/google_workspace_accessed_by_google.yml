name: Google Workspace accessed by Google
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Create a signal when Google accesses your Google Workspace tenant using administrative tools.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace logs to detect access events, which are part of Google's Access Transparency logs.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine the scope of Google's access activity, which can be found in the access event in the Google Workspace event log.
  2. Review which Google Workspace user and resources were accessed by Google.
  3. Investigate the resources being accessed to determine if there is a legitimate reason for Google to review them.
